# Hi there, I'm Sebasti√°n! üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a developer and writer who loves to create and experiment. Currently, I'm on a journey to build my development skills from the ground up, while also pursuing my passion for storytelling.

## About Me

- üöÄ **Learning & Growing**: I started my development journey in June 2024 and am documenting my progress from zero. Follow along as I work on projects, solve challenges, and explore new technologies.
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Fiction Writer**: Alongside coding, I write monthly fiction at [RelatoCorto.com](https://www.relatocorto.com), where each issue features a standalone story and previous content disappears from the live site. It's an experiment in minimalist publishing!
- üå± **Current Focus**: I'm currently diving deep into web development with a focus on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.

## My Projects

- **[RelatoCorto.com](https://github.com/itusebastian/relatocorto-blog)**: My fiction blog where I post monthly issues, with only the latest available online.
