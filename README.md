# 👋 Hi, I'm Sebastián

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate software developer, creative writer, and former web designer. I thrive on exploring both the technical and creative sides of projects, and I enjoy working across disciplines to grow as a developer and a storyteller. My repositories showcase my development journey, my passion for literature, and even a nod to the legacy of my first entrepreneurial venture.

## 🚀 About Me

- 💻 **Software Developer**: Starting from zero in June 2024, I am documenting my progress as a software developer, exploring technologies like JavaScript, Python, React.js, and Node.js.
- ✍️ **Fiction Writer**: I am deeply committed to writing, from short stories to novels. I'm currently working with the [Fiction Forge](https://github.com/itusebastian/fiction-forge) private repository to create new stories. You can find my writing finalized stories on my blog at [RelatoCorto.com](https://RelatoCorto.com) where I share my serialized fiction monthly.
- 🌐 **Web Design Legacy**: I'm also proud of my roots as a web designer. My past work with Zitux is commemorated in the [Zitux](https://github.com/itusebastian/zitux-legacy) repository, which serves as a tribute to the company I co-founded in 2009.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Python
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
- **Other**: Writing, storytelling, content management
